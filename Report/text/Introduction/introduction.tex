\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Netflix is a streaming service that provides access to many movies and series for a monthly subscription fee. The initial idea was to have a single place for all the movies and series, but some companies withdrew their licenses to create their own streaming services. The net result is that there now are many streaming services who each require their own subscription and who each provide access to a smaller number of movies and series.

Our Business idea is to have a collected service that provides access to all, or at least many, of the streaming services through a single client and with a single larger subscription fee. To be competitive on the price we will rely on working out some deal with the included streaming services that allows us to pay them from our subscription money dependant on usage of their service.
