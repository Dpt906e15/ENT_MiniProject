\subsubsection{Design Approach}
We have chosen to use the Customer Insight\cite{1} techinique in our design approach. If we had the funds available, we could hire social scientists which could sketch profiles of the customer segment. As this is not the case, we have made use of the Empathy Map, which is also known as the ``really simple customer profiler''\cite{2}.

The first thing to do when using the empathy map, is to brainstorm all possible customer segments that one might want to serve with the business model. Then three promising candidates should be chosen, from which one is selected for the first profiling exercise. Then a customer from that customer segment is thought up, by giving the customer characteristics, such as a name, income, occupation, and so on. Afterwards a profile is build for the customer by asking and answering six questions.
These questions should be put on a whiteboard or flipchart, as seen in figure \ref{fig:empathy_map}(Hence, empathy map), and the answers could be written on stick-it notes and placed on the questions.
