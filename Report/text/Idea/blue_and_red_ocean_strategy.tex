\subsection{Blue And Red Ocean}

Red oceans and Blue oceans make up the market universe, as defined by \textit{Kim} and \textit{Mauborgne} \cite{Blue_ocean_strategy}. Red oceans cover all the existing industries and businesses (known market space), and the Blue oceans cover the ones which are not created yet (unknown market space), respectively.

We consider our company to be mostly in Red ocean territory because Red ocean strategy is a market-competing strategy, and we would build our platform on the premise of using media provided by our competitors, with an already established market rules. We say mostly, not entirely, since our platform will have a bit of novelty where nobody else  has created such a platform so far to effectively unify this type of media streaming content. This falls under the description of Blue ocean strategy where something new is created within red oceans territory by expanding existing industry boundaries.
