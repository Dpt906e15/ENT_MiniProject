\section{Idea}
\label{sec:idea}
To elaborate on the idea, we want to analyse it and its market. For this, we have used some existing models, being Porter's Five Forces and resource-based theory. Some theory for market strategy will be needed as well. This section will elaborate on each of the mentioned methods, as well as covering the blue and red ocean strategies.
