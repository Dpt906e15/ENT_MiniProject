\section{Business Idea}
\label{sec:idea}
Our idea has been given the working title ``Watchr''. The intention is to collect all streaming services\footnote{We will refer to streaming services providing movies, series and TV shows as simply ``streaming services''} into a single interface. This interface will serve as a gateway to the different services, providing access to their shows.

To elaborate on the idea, we want to analyse it and its market. For this, we have used some existing models, being Porter's Five Forces and resource-based theory. This section will elaborate on each of the mentioned methods, as well as covering the blue and red ocean strategies.
